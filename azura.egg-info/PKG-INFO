Summary: Azura is an add-on to the math library. It contains many functions and 2 sub-libraries (percents and geography). In the sub-library, you can calculate percent proportions. In the sub-library you can use the Haversine function with distancetype conversions. In the built-in functions you can use geometric functions and also you can refer to pi, e, tau. In the built-in library some functions will have a perimeter, simplification. You can put 's' for pi to be converted to 3.14. Otherwise, if you want the normal pi, simply put any other string.
