## Overview
**Azura** is a libary made to help new learners actually learn. Programming and developement can be shrouded in mystery by tedious and complicated math concepts. Instead of forcing young learners to develop an advanced knowledge in math before learning programming syntax, they should learn by being given these math concepts. **Azura is not a complex library with complex functions.** It is perfect for new programmers to learn syntax in python without being daunted in math.

## Installation 
`pip install azura`

## Documentation
Math definitons use a simplification parameter. If the parameter is filled with "s" then the definition will be simplified to the hundreths. For example π = 3.14 if simplification is "s". If simplification is left as anything else it will be the full form (EX: π = 3.14159...)

`print(Azura.Math_Pi("s"))
 prints "3.14"`

 `print(Azura.Math_E("t"))
 prints "2.718281828459045..."`
